		<td>Orange</td>
		<td>The Soul Stone represented the soul. It would later go on to cultivate a
			reputation of mystery throughout the galaxy. Even those who were well versed
			in the powers, and even locations, of the other five Stones, had little
			concrete knowledge regarding the Soul Stone to the point of only knowing its name.
			Despite, or perhaps because of, this aura of mystery, it would eventually be
			considered as the most dangerous of all the Infinity Stones.
			Even the Asgardians knew little of the stone, with Thor stating no one had
			ever seen it or knew where it was.</td>

		<td>Time</td>
		<td>Green</td>
		<td>As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs over the flow of time,
			the Time Stone is among the most powerful artifacts in all existence.
			Due to its power, it cannot be held and used by anyone not powerful enough
			to withstand it, thus forcing Agamotto to create the Eye of Agamotto as a
			container to allow other sufficiently advanced sorcerers to wield it.</td>

	<tr id="space">
		<td>Space</td>
		<td>Blue</td>
		<td>As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs over space, the Space Stone
			grants the wielder absolute control over space itself. It is primarily used
			to open portals to other locations and can even allow interdimensional travel.
			As one of the six Infinity Stones, the Space Stone ranks as among the most powerful
			artifacts in the universe, with Black Widow saying it has the power to wipe
			out an entire planet. Out of all the artifacts on Odin's Vault, it was the
			only one that managed to impress Hela, who said it was "not bad".</td>

		<td>Mind</td>
		<td>Yellow</td>
		<td>As the Infinity Stone that represents and governs the fabric of mind,
			the Mind Stone grants whoever holds it complete control over the hearts
			and minds of others. Like with all the other Infinity Stones, it is among
			the most powerful artifacts in all existence.
			<br>
			At its core, the Stone contains a highly advanced intelligence framework,
			akin to an incredibly powerful supercomputer operating similarly to a sentient mind.
			The Stone's intelligence is powerful enough to enhance and spontaneously
			grant sentience to the artificial beings Ultron and Vision. As implied
			by this intelligence, the Stone itself also possesses a form of sentience,
			with the Stone directly communicating with Vision in order to warn him of
			the coming threat of Thanos.</td>
		<td><img  src="assets/images/mind_stone.png" alt="mind stone"></td>
	</tr>
	<tr id="reality">
		<td>Reality</td>
		<td>Red</td>
		<td>As the Infinity Stone that represented and governs over reality,
			the Reality Stone granted its user absolute control over reality
			itself. However, like all other Infinity Stones, due to it being
			the most powerful artifact in existence, it can only be wielded
			by beings of sufficient power and inside beings of no powers, it
			will inevitably kill them, as evidenced with Jane Foster. The Reality
			Stone's power is so great that it is capable of affecting reality on
			a universal scale, as Malekith would have been able to use the Stone
			to cover the whole universe in darkness. It is also indestructible,
			as not even the immensely powerful Thor wielding Mj√∏lnir could
			destroy it.</td>

	</tr>
	<tr id="power">
		<td>Power</td>
		<td>Purple</td>
		<td>As the Infinity Stone that embodies both the sustaining and
			destructive forces of the universe, the Power Stone grants its
			wielder tremendous energy manipulation capabilities. Due to the
			amount of energy the Power Stone releases, it is the most
			destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in terms of raw power.
			Like all Infinity Stones, the Power Stone is among the most
			powerful artifacts in the universe, with only beings of an
			extraordinary constitution being able to use it while less
			powerful beings would erupt in a violent explosion.</td>
